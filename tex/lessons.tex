\chapter{Lessons Learned}

\section{Amy}
Trying to force new code to match legacy code can be more effort than it?s worth.  It?s always okay to branch and attempt a larger rewrite if it will make everyone?s lives easier.  Also, be sure to understand your own syntax when writing tests.

\section{Emily}
Remote teamwork can be tough. Writing tests that guarantee no regressions is surprisingly difficult, especially when testing against remote files.

\section{Amarto}
Debugging a compiler is like playing whack-a-mole -- it?s much easier to write a script to isolate the action you?re trying to debug, and then gradually build it back into the compiler.
