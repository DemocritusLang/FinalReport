\section{Statements}
    
    Statements written in a Democritus program are run from the top to bottom, sequentially. Statements can reduce to the following:

    \subsection{Expressions}
        An expression statement consists of an expression followed by a semicolon. Expressions in expression statements will be evaluated, with their values calculated.

    \subsection{Return Statements}
        A return statement is either a \texttt{RETURN SEMI} or \texttt{RETURN expr SEMI}. They are used as endpoints of a function, and control from a function returns to the original caller when a return statement is executed. Returns may be empty or return a type, though non-void functions must return an expression of their type.

    \subsection{Nested Blocks}
        A nested block is another statement list encapsulated within braces \verb|{}|.

    \subsection{Conditional Statements}
        Conditional statements follow the \verb|IF (boolean expr) stmt1 ELSE stmt2| format. When the \texttt{expr} evaluates to true, \texttt{stmt1} is run. Otherwise, if an \texttt{ELSE} and \texttt{stmt2} have been specified, \texttt{stmt2} is run. 

    \subsection{Conditional Loops}
        A conditional loop is similar to a conditional statement, except in that it will loop or run repeatedly until its given boolean expression evaluates to \texttt{false}. In the case that the expression never evaluates to \texttt{false}, an infinite loop will occur.

        \medskip \noindent
        Democritus eliminates the \texttt{while} keyword sometimes used in conditional iteration. Conditional loops follow the \verb|FOR (expr1;boolean expr2;expr3) stmt| format where \texttt{expr1} and \texttt{expr3} are optional expressions to be evaluated prior to entering the \texttt{for} loop and upon each loop completion, respectively. Prior to entering or re-entering the loop, \texttt{expr2} is evaluated; control only transfers to \texttt{stmt} if this evaluation returns true. If both \texttt{expr1} and \texttt{expr3} are omitted, a simpler \texttt{for} loop can be written of the form \verb|FOR (boolean expr) stmt|. 

    \bigskip \bigskip \bigskip \noindent
    The full gammar for statements is as follows:

    \begin{verbatim}
stmt_list:
    /* nothing */  
  | stmt_list stmt 

stmt:
    expr SEMI 
  | RETURN SEMI 
  | RETURN expr SEMI 
  | LBRACE stmt_list RBRACE 
  | IF LPAREN expr RPAREN stmt %prec NOELSE
  | IF LPAREN expr RPAREN stmt ELSE stmt   
  | FOR LPAREN expr_opt SEMI expr SEMI expr_opt RPAREN stmt
  | FOR LPAREN expr RPAREN stmt 
    \end{verbatim}
