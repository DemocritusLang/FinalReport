\section{Concurrency}
	\subsection{Overview}
		Democritus intends to cater to modern software engineering use cases. Developments in the field are steering us more and more towards highly concurrent programming as the scale at which software is used trends upward.

	\subsection{Spawning Threads}
		To spawn threads, Democritus uses a wrapper around the C-language \texttt{pthread} family of functions.

		The \texttt{$thread_t$} data type wraps \texttt{$pthread_t$}.

		To spawn a thread, the thread function takes a variable number of arguments where the first argument is a function and the remaining optional arguments are the arguments for that function. It returns an error code.

		The \texttt{detach} boolean determines whether or not the parent thread will be able to join on the thread or not.
		\begin{lstlisting}
        {	
		function thread(f function, arg *void, arg, nthreads int) *void;
	}
		\end{lstlisting}
